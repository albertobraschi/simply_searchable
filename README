SimplySearchable
================

SimplySearchable is a search plugin created by Rida Al Barazi to be used in SpinBits's Skeleton App.

The main goal of SimplySearchable is to make it easy to do queries on your model by automagically create some named_scope methods for common conditions.

This plugin adds a method to the model named "list" that will find and filter records smartly.

Example:
--------
If you have the following attributes in you posts table:

  Post
  	id:integer
  	title:string
  	body:text
  	created_at:datetime
  	updated_at:datetime

In your Model:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  	simply_searchable
  end

This will create the following named scopes:

  named_scope where_id,         lambda {|value| { :conditions => ["id = ?", value] }}
  named_scope where_title,      lambda {|value| { :conditions => ["title like ?", "%#{value}%"] }}
  named_scope where_body,       lambda {|value| { :conditions => ["body like ?", "%#{value}%"] }}
  named_scope where_created_at, lambda {|value| { :conditions => ["created_at = ?", value] }}
  named_scope where_updated_at, lambda {|value| { :conditions => ["updated_at = ?", value] }}

It will also create the method 'list' which you can use like:

  Post.list(:title => 'abc', :created_at => Date.today)
  
Which will return the posts that contain 'abc' in their title and created today.

By default SimplySearchable list will_paginate, you can still customize its settings or disable it:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    simply_searchable :will_paginate => false
  end

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    simply_searchable :per_page => 20
  end
